# An Simple GLFW and GLAD Template For C/C++
Just Creates A Simple GLFW and GLAD template that anyone can use and alter however they want. I made this whilst trying to 
figure out how to make a GLFW project and got annoyed so i thought maybe others might also get annoyed. so I made this very 
simple template for anyone to use anytime

![Screenshot of the project being open in my IDE of choice CLION, but it should work in any that supports the CMake Systems.](readme/TemplateImage.png)
